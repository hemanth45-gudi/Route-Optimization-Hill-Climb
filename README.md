This project is an Arduino-based Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) that uses five push buttons and a 16×2 LCD to simulate a simple voting system. Four buttons are assigned to different parties, and each press records a vote and confirms it using an LED indicator. The LCD continuously displays the live vote count for all parties. A separate result button calculates the total votes, identifies the winning party, and shows the final result on the display. The system also handles tie cases and no-vote situations. After displaying the result, all counters reset automatically so the voting process can start again.
