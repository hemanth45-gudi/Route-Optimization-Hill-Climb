The Hill Climb algorithm is a fast and efficient method specifically applied to route optimization in delivery systems. It works by starting with an initial route and iteratively making small modifications, such as reordering stops, to continuously reduce the total travel time or distance. If a modification improves efficiency, it is accepted, and the process repeats until no further improvements are possible, resulting in a locally optimized route. This approach is computationally lightweight and can adapt quickly to real-time changes like traffic or roadblocks, making it ideal for small to medium-sized delivery networks.
